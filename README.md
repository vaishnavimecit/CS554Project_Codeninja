# CS554Project_Codeninja MAKE A CHANGE

Spring 2020 Web programming II final project using Javascript and NoSQL

## General Overview & Functions 

Our main goal is to implement a dashboard for Covid-19 crisis in which we help connect hospitals & donors. It is a single page application that runs multiple web servers and processes. This page will have private and public content. The dashboard can be viewed by the public. The logged-in users can donate to the crisis’ relief funds, donors can donate based on their city, hospitals can post their clinic needs like PPE, and contact the admin about the their concerns & questions. The administrator will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete entries and manage the database. The data will be gathered from various sources on the net, as well as having the ability for users to input data manually that will be stored in the database and integrated with the outside data streams into our User Interface.

● Adam Undus (10420747) 
● Sri Harsha Varma Konda (10445521) 
● Sushil Saladi (10434422) 
● Vaishnavi Gopalakrishnan (10444180) 

## Course Technologies 
● React JS: It will be used as our web application framework for better rendering. Our component library to manage different parts of the UI. 
● Redis: Redis can be used to cache data for improvised user experience
● Firebase: It is a real-time NoSQL, cloud-hosted database that stores data in JSON format. It helps users to login using email/password or third-party authentication.

## Independent Technologies 
● React-Google Charts    It is an npm package that helps in the pictorial representation of the data. 
● Google Maps API For finding the current location

## Future Enhancements 
● Chatbot To provide users with requested data using a live chat. 
● Interactive user interface Users can enter health-related data from their city and it can be validated and displayed. 
● Advanced search To search for the exact word, language, domain, etc

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
